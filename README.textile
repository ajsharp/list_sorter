ListSorter
==========

This plugin is an adapted version of Recipe 5 of Chad Fowler's Rails Recipes.

ListSorter provides a common interface to sort ActiveRecord models you're representing via html lists (<ul> or <ol>) in your view templates.

There are two methods in the ListSorter module.

collection_sort - This method sorts a collection of one AR object's child models. I originally used it to sort a Product's photos. 

Requirements
============
1. Prototype + Scriptaculous
3. acts_as_list plugin (or possibly some derivative of this, though I haven't tested any others so I can't be sure)


Example
=======

In your models:
<pre>
class Product < ActiveRecord::Base
	has_many :photos, :order => :position
end

class Photo < ActiveRecord::Base
	acts_as_list :scope => :product
end
</pre>

In your controller:

class ProductsController < ActionController::Base
  sort_list 'bios'
  
  private
    def index
      bios = sortable_list
    end
  
    def sortable_list
      Products.all(:order => 'position')
    end
end


In routes.rb:

map.sort "products/sort/:id/:parent/:children", :controller => 'products', :action => 'sort'


In your view:

<ul id="photos">
	<li id="<%= dom_id(photo) %>">
		<%= image_tag photo.image.url(:thumb) %>
	</li>
</ul>

<%= sortable_element 'photos', 
	:url => sort_path(:id => @product.id, :parent => "product", :children => "photos"), 
	:complete => visual_effect(:highlight, 'photos') %>
